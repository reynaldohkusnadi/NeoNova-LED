# Story 2.5 — A11y pass (keyboard reachability, focus rings, semantics)

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to validate keyboard reachability, focus-visible styles, and semantic roles across the core sections,
**so that** accessibility defaults are in place before motion and form logic are introduced.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All section copy reads from `/content/site.ts`; no hardcoded strings. [Epic AC]
2. Keyboard navigation path verified; focus-visible styles present. [Epic AC]
3. No Client-side animation logic introduced. [Epic AC]
4. Visible focus styles across Navbar, Carousel wrapper, Proven Impact, Results Band. [Source: prd/07-performance-accessibility-and-seo.md#7.2]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add focus-visible styles and verify tab order across components
- [ ] Add `role`/ARIA attributes where applicable (e.g., landmarks for header/nav)
- [ ] Validate hit targets ≥ 44×44 where interactive elements exist
- [ ] Run axe-core locally/in preview to ensure no critical violations

## Dev Notes

### Accessibility Architecture
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; ensure no motion logic in this epic’s RSC shells. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.6]
- Keyboard parity and visible focus rings required. [Source: prd/07-performance-accessibility-and-seo.md#7.2]

## Testing
- Manual keyboard walkthrough; axe-core report shows no criticals in preview.
