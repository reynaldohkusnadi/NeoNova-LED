# Story 1.5 — Author developer docs (README, ENV, TESTING)

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to write onboarding and operations docs (`README.md`, `ENV.md`, `TESTING.md`),
**so that** contributors can set up, run, and validate the project consistently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Build and dev server run locally with documented steps.
2. Page renders with RSC-first layout and placeholder sections.
3. Content read exclusively from `/content/site.ts`.
4. CI passes on Preview; baseline Lighthouse ≥90, axe: no criticals.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] `README.md`: project overview, prerequisites, setup, scripts, deploy flow (Preview → Prod)
- [x] `ENV.md`: document required env vars and where they are stored (Vercel Encrypted Env Vars)
- [x] `TESTING.md`: local validation (typecheck, lint), preview checks (Lighthouse CI, axe-core), budgets
- [x] Note analytics events and where to find them in code (`lib/analytics/track.ts`)
- [x] Link to architecture docs and PRD sections for deeper context

## Dev Notes

### Build, CI & Quality Gates
- CI steps and thresholds (typecheck, lint, Lighthouse CI, axe-core, bundle guard). [Source: architecture/04-infrastructure-and-deployment-topology.md#4.3]

### Backend & Env Vars
- Server Action email delivery and env vars. [Source: architecture/03-backend-and-integrations.md#3.2]
- Env separation Preview vs Production; storage via Vercel encrypted env vars. [Source: architecture/04-infrastructure-and-deployment-topology.md#4.7]

### Analytics
- Event taxonomy and dispatcher expectations. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.9; prd/06-features.md#6.7]

## Testing
- Follow `TESTING.md` to run `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint` locally and validate preview checks.
- Confirm docs provide reproducible steps matching CI configuration.
