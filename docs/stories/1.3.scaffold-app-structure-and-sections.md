# Story 1.3 — Scaffold app structure and sections (placeholders only)

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to scaffold the Next.js 14 app structure and section placeholders per architecture,
**so that** we have an RSC-first layout ready to receive content and future animations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Build and dev server run locally with documented steps.
2. Page renders with RSC-first layout and placeholder sections.
3. Content read exclusively from `/content/site.ts`.
4. CI passes on Preview; baseline Lighthouse ≥90, axe: no criticals.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create `app/layout.tsx` (RSC): html/head/body, `<Analytics />` mount, theme/tokens
- [x] Create `app/page.tsx` (RSC): imports typed `content` and composes sections
- [x] Create `(sections)/` directories and placeholder components:
  - [x] `Hero3D/ClientHero.tsx` (client stub) and `Hero3D/StaticHero.tsx` (RSC)
  - [x] `Carousel/ClientCarousel.tsx` (client stub)
  - [x] `ResultsBand/ClientResults.tsx` (client stub)
  - [x] `Form/SlideOverForm.tsx` (client stub)
- [x] Create stubs in `lib/` for analytics and hooks: `analytics/track.ts`, `a11y/usePrefersReducedMotion.ts`, `motion/useGsapScrollTrigger.ts`
- [x] Ensure components accept props matching the content map (no hardcoded copy)

## Dev Notes

### App Structure & RSC Boundaries
- Follow the prescribed structure for `app/`, `(sections)/`, `content/`, `lib/`, `styles/`. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.1]
- Only make components Client when needed (WebGL, GSAP, form). [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.2]

### Motion Hooks & Parity
- Prepare `useGsapScrollTrigger` and `usePrefersReducedMotion` stubs; ensure future timelines can be created/destroyed properly and disabled under reduced motion. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.4]

### Content Wiring
- `page.tsx` reads `content/site.ts` and passes props to section components. [Source: prd/05-content-and-information-architecture.md#5.2]

### Performance & Budgets
- Keep client stubs minimal to preserve app shell budget and avoid heavy bundles. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.7]

## Testing
- `pnpm dev` renders layout and placeholder sections without runtime errors.
- `pnpm build` succeeds; no Client component imported unnecessarily into RSC boundaries. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.2]
- Validation executed: homepage rendered expected content ("Neo Nova:" headline) under local server.
