# Story 6.4 — Document deploy, rollback, and env management in README

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** tech lead,
**I want** to document deploy/rollback procedures and environment variable management,
**so that** the team can operate deployments confidently and recover quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. README includes deploy flow, rollback steps, and env management guide. [Source: epic]
2. Rollback tested at least once pre-launch; steps recorded. [Source: architecture/04-infrastructure-and-deployment-topology.md#4.9]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Update `README.md` with deploy flow: PR→Preview, `main`→Prod; how to Promote/Rollback in Vercel
- [ ] Add env management section referencing Vercel Encrypted Env Vars and separation (Preview vs Prod)
- [ ] Record a test rollback (promote previous deploy) and document outcome

## Dev Notes

### Ops Simplicity

- Use Vercel’s Promote/Rollback for instant reversions; document with screenshots/links as needed. [Source: architecture/04-infrastructure-and-deployment-topology.md#4.2]

## Testing

- Perform and document a rollback on a preview environment; verify successful switch.
