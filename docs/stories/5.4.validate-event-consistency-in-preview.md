# Story 5.4 — Validate event consistency in preview deploy

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to validate event consistency and absence of duplicates in preview,
**so that** analytics data is trustworthy before production.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. 100% events from PRD §6.7 present and accurate. [Source: prd/06-features.md#6.7]
2. No duplicates on mount/unmount cycles; dedupe proven. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.9]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Enable preview deploy and verify `<Analytics />` mounted once
- [ ] Exercise flows (hero, carousel, results, CTAs, form) and inspect events
- [ ] Record findings and any fixes needed; adjust dedupe where necessary

## Dev Notes

### Preview Validation

- Use Vercel preview with console inspection to validate event stream. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.9]

## Testing

- Manual validation checklist executed; issues captured and addressed prior to release.
