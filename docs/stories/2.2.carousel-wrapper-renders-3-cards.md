# Story 2.2 â€” Carousel wrapper renders 3 cards from `content.cardsCore`

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** an RSC Carousel wrapper that renders three cards from the typed content model,
**so that** the section shows correct copy without introducing client animation logic yet.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All section copy reads from `/content/site.ts`; no hardcoded strings. [Epic AC]
2. Keyboard navigation path verified; focus-visible styles present. [Epic AC]
3. No Client-side animation logic introduced. [Epic AC]
4. Exactly 3 cards rendered from `content.cardsCore` in order. [Source: prd/05-content-and-information-architecture.md#5.3; prd/06-features.md#6.3]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create `CardCarousel` RSC wrapper that accepts `[Card, Card, Card]`
- [x] Render minimal card shells (eyebrow, headline, blurbShort)
- [x] Provide keyboard focusable card containers; ENTER on CTA will be wired later
- [x] Ensure no client hooks or animation side-effects in this story

## Dev Notes

### Content Source & Schema
- Tuple-typed `cardsCore` ensures exactly 3 items. [Source: prd/05-content-and-information-architecture.md#5.3]

### Architecture & Boundaries
- Keep wrapper RSC; animation comes later in EPIC-003. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.2]

### Accessibility
- Keyboard-focusable items; visible focus; no motion yet. [Source: prd/07-performance-accessibility-and-seo.md#7.2]

## Testing
- Snapshot/DOM test confirms rendering of 3 items from content in order.
