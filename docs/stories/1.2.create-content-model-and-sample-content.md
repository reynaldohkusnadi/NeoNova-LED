# Story 1.2 — Create content model `/content/site.ts` and sample content

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to define a typed content model and seed sample content in `/content/site.ts`,
**so that** all sections render copy from a single, strongly‑typed source of truth.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Build and dev server run locally with documented steps.
2. Page renders with RSC-first layout and placeholder sections.
3. Content read exclusively from `/content/site.ts`.
4. CI passes on Preview; baseline Lighthouse ≥90, axe: no criticals.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Define TypeScript interfaces for `Card`, `Stat`, and `Content` exactly as per PRD §5.3
  - [x] Use tuple types for `cardsCore: [Card, Card, Card]` and `stats: [Stat, Stat]`
  - [x] Export `content` constant with `as const satisfies Content`
- [x] Populate sample content values aligned with copy guidelines (headlines, blurbShort limits)
- [x] Ensure `content.form` fields exist (`success`, `ctaPrimary`, `ctaSecondary`, `whatsappPrefill`)
- [x] Add notes in file header on editing workflow (authoring via PR → preview)
- [x] Wire a basic import path to be used by `app/page.tsx` later (no runtime usage yet)

## Dev Notes

### Content Model & Mapping
- Location is `/content/site.ts` as the single source of truth. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.1]
- Component ↔ content map defines which fields power each section. [Source: prd/05-content-and-information-architecture.md#5.2]
- Model schema requires exactly 3 core cards and 2 stats in v1. [Source: prd/05-content-and-information-architecture.md#5.3]

### Rendering Approach
- RSC-first layout reads content directly in `page.tsx` and passes typed props to Client components. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.1, #2.2]

### Acceptance Constraints
- Page must render only from `/content/site.ts`; no hardcoded strings. [Source: prd/05-content-and-information-architecture.md#5.6]

### Project Structure Notes
- Keep `content/` at project root with `site.ts` export; avoid adding CMS in v1. [Source: architecture/01-architecture-overview-and-tenets.md#high-level-decisions]

## Testing
- `pnpm typecheck` must pass with tuple lengths enforced (3 cards, 2 stats). [Source: prd/05-content-and-information-architecture.md#5.3]
- Preview deploy should show sections reading only from `content` when integrated in later stories. [Source: prd/05-content-and-information-architecture.md#5.6]
