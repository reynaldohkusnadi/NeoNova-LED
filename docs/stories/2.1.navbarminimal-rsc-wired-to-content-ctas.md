# Story 2.1 — NavbarMinimal (RSC) wired to `content.form` CTAs

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement a minimal RSC navbar that reads CTA labels from `content.form`,
**so that** all header actions are content-driven with proper accessibility and analytics hooks.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All section copy reads from `/content/site.ts`; no hardcoded strings. [Epic AC]
2. Keyboard navigation path verified; focus-visible styles present. [Epic AC]
3. No Client-side animation logic introduced. [Epic AC]
4. Navbar CTAs render from `content.form.ctaPrimary` and `content.form.ctaSecondary`. [Source: prd/05-content-and-information-architecture.md#5.2]
5. Sticky header ≤ 72px; never overlaps focus. [Source: prd/06-features.md#6.1]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create `NavbarMinimal` as an RSC component
  - [ ] Read `ctaPrimary` and `ctaSecondary` from `content.form`
  - [ ] Provide `data-` hooks for analytics (click handlers will be wired later)
  - [ ] Ensure sticky behavior with proper z-index token
- [ ] Add keyboard/tab order and visible focus styles
- [ ] Add unit snapshot to ensure CTAs render from content

## Dev Notes

### Content Source & Mapping
- Navbar pulls CTAs from `content.form` (no hardcoded strings). [Source: prd/05-content-and-information-architecture.md#5.2, #5.6]

### Architecture & RSC Boundaries
- Keep Navbar as RSC; only wrap small client handler later for click analytics if needed. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.2]

### Analytics Expectations
- Event names `cta_click_primary`, `cta_click_secondary` with context. Deferral of actual handlers is acceptable in this epic. [Source: prd/06-features.md#6.7; architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.9]

### Accessibility
- Keyboard-first, focus-visible rings. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.6; prd/07-performance-accessibility-and-seo.md#7.2]

## Testing
- Verify CTAs come from `content.form` via unit test.
- Manual a11y check: TAB order and visible focus.
