# Story 5.2 — Wire events in components; add dedupe on visibility events

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to wire analytics events across components with dedupe guards,
**so that** events are emitted once and payloads remain consistent.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. 100% events from PRD §6.7 present and accurate. [Source: prd/06-features.md#6.7]
2. No duplicates on mount/unmount cycles. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.9]
3. Event payloads include common fields and contextual fields (e.g., `section`, `id`). [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.9]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Navbar CTAs: `cta_click_primary`, `cta_click_secondary` with `{ location: 'navbar' }`
- [ ] Hero: `hero_view` (first visibility), `hero_interact` as applicable
- [ ] Carousel: `carousel_view`, `carousel_card_focus` (id), `carousel_swipe` ({ direction, distance })
- [ ] Results Band: `results_band_view`, `stat_reveal` (id)
- [ ] Form: `form_open`, `form_submit_success`, `form_submit_error`; optional `whatsapp_deeplink`
- [ ] Use a dedupe guard in each component to prevent repeated visibility events

## Dev Notes

### Central Helper

- Use `track()` for consistency and guards. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.9]

### Naming & Consistency

- Follow PRD §6.7 event names and payloads; add `{ section, id }` where relevant. [Source: prd/06-features.md#6.7]

## Testing

- Manual preview validation and console inspection to ensure single-fire events.
