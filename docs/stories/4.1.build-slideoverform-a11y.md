# Story 4.1 â€” Build SlideOverForm with a11y (focus trap, aria-live, ESC close)

## Status

In Review

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement a client SlideOverForm with proper accessibility (focus trap, aria-live, ESC to close),
**so that** users can open and interact with the lead form accessibly and predictably before wiring the server action.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Focus is trapped within the slide-over when open; ESC closes the dialog. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.6]
2. `aria-live="polite"` announces form submit success/error messages. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.6]
3. Form fields: Name, Work Email, Company, WhatsApp (client-side Zod validation). [Source: architecture/03-backend-and-integrations.md#3.1]
4. No secrets or server logic in client bundle; server submission is out of scope in this story. [Source: architecture/03-backend-and-integrations.md#3.4]
5. All copy pulled from `content/site.ts` where applicable (CTAs). [Source: prd/05-content-and-information-architecture.md#5.2]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create `Form/SlideOverForm.tsx` (Client) with open/close state and focus trap
- [x] Add Zod schema for client pre-validation (same shape as server will use)
- [x] Add `aria-live` region for result messages; ensure announcements on state change
- [x] Wire header CTA buttons (from Navbar) to open the slide-over
- [x] Ensure visible focus rings and keyboard tab order
- [x] Provide a placeholder submit handler (no server action yet)

## Dev Notes

### Accessibility Architecture

- Focus trap, keyboard parity, `aria-live` messaging for form UI. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.6; prd/07-performance-accessibility-and-seo.md#7.2]

### Fields & Validation

- Form fields and Zod validation alignment with server. [Source: architecture/03-backend-and-integrations.md#3.1]

### Content Integration

- CTA labels read from `content.form`. [Source: prd/05-content-and-information-architecture.md#5.2]

## Testing

- Keyboard-only walkthrough: open form via CTA, tab through fields, ESC to close.
- Axe-core: no critical issues in preview for the slide-over.

## Dev Agent Record

- Implemented `NavCtaBridge` client bridge to keep `NavbarMinimal` as RSC while wiring CTA clicks via `data-analytics-event`.
- Implemented `SlideOverForm` with focus trap, `role="dialog" aria-modal`, ESC close, and `aria-live` region for submit results.
- Added Zod for client validation; fields: Name, Work Email, Company, WhatsApp.
- Updated `app/page.tsx` to render `SlideOverForm` without props; labels pulled from `content.site`.
- All tests passing; typecheck clean.
