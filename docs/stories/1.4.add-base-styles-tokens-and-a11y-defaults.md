# Story 1.4 — Add base styles/tokens and accessibility defaults

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to establish base styles, design tokens, and accessibility defaults,
**so that** the UI is consistent, performant, and meets AA accessibility from the start.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Build and dev server run locally with documented steps.
2. Page renders with RSC-first layout and placeholder sections.
3. Content read exclusively from `/content/site.ts`.
4. CI passes on Preview; baseline Lighthouse ≥90, axe: no criticals.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Configure Tailwind and set up `styles/globals.css` and `styles/tokens.css` (CSS custom props)
- [x] Add Inter via `next/font` with appropriate subsets and display strategy
- [x] Establish focus-visible styles and keyboard-visible outlines
- [ ] Ensure color contrast meets AA on primary backgrounds and CTAs
- [x] Document tokens (palette, radii, z-index, spacing scale) and usage
- [ ] Verify `next/image` defaults and add base `sizes` guidance in code comments

## Dev Notes

### Tokens & Styles
- Define tokens in `styles/tokens.css` and wire through Tailwind where needed. [Source: epics/EPIC-001-foundation-and-scaffolding.md#outcomes]
- Keep styles minimal; rely on Tailwind utilities for most layout work. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.1]

### Accessibility Defaults
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; ensure base components do not animate by default. [Source: prd/07-performance-accessibility-and-seo.md#7.2]
- Provide visible focus rings, keyboard parity, and proper roles/aria in future components. [Source: prd/07-performance-accessibility-and-seo.md#7.2]

### Performance
- Fonts via `next/font` with subset + `display: optional`; keep budgets. [Source: prd/07-performance-accessibility-and-seo.md#7.1]

## Testing
- Axe-core baseline check shows no critical issues in preview. [Source: architecture/04-infrastructure-and-deployment-topology.md#4.3]
- Lighthouse (desktop + Moto emulation) ≥ 90 after base styling. [Source: prd/07-performance-accessibility-and-seo.md#7.4]
