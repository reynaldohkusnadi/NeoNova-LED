# Story 3.4 — Validate performance budgets and a11y under reduced motion

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to validate performance budgets and accessibility behavior under reduced motion,
**so that** we ensure the motion layer meets the project’s targets and parity requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. 3D payload ≤ 1.2 MB; app shell JS ≤ 140 KB gzip. [Source: prd/07-performance-accessibility-and-seo.md#7.1]
2. Reduced motion disables pin/scrub everywhere; StaticHero used. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.4, #2.5]
3. No animation tick > 50ms; Lighthouse ≥ 90; axe-core no criticals. [Source: prd/07-performance-accessibility-and-seo.md#7.1–7.5]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Add CI/dev scripts that output 3D payload size and app shell gzip size
- [x] Run Lighthouse CI and axe-core in preview; document results in `TESTING.md`
- [x] Manual verification: toggle reduced motion; ensure parity across sections

## Dev Notes

### Monitoring & Budgets

- Use Speed Insights over time; enforce Lighthouse CI in PRs. [Source: prd/07-performance-accessibility-and-seo.md#7.1, #7.4]

### Accessibility

- Verify keyboard parity remains with motion added; no focus traps or scroll locks. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.6]

## Testing

- CI passes with budgets respected; preview deploy confirms Lighthouse/Axe gates.

## Dev Agent Record

Agent Model Used: dev

Tasks / Subtasks Checkboxes:

- Budget script prints app shell and 3D payload: [x]
- LHCI and axe steps wired and documented: [x]
- Reduced motion parity manually validated: [x]

Debug Log References:

- `scripts/check-budgets.mjs` updated for robust parsing.
- `TESTING.md` augmented with RM and budgets validation steps.

Completion Notes:

- Budgets hold with current motion layer. RM path verified to skip animations globally.
