# Story 3.3 â€” Add minimal GSAP reveals to Carousel and Results Band

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to add minimal GSAP reveal animations to Carousel and Results Band wrappers,
**so that** the page gains motion without breaking performance or accessibility budgets.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Reduced motion disables all reveals. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.4]
2. Timelines created/destroyed on mount/unmount; no leaks. [Source: prd/06-features.md#6.8]
3. No single animation tick > 50ms; no CLS > 0.01. [Source: prd/07-performance-accessibility-and-seo.md#7.1]
4. Emits analytics once per section where applicable. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.9]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add simple enter/fade/scale reveals to Carousel wrapper using `useGsapScrollTrigger`
- [ ] Add count-up enter effect to Results Band guarded by reduced motion
- [ ] Ensure dedupe of visibility events and cleanup in StrictMode

## Dev Notes

### Motion Discipline
- Avoid nested pins; keep durations shorter on mobile; fixed container heights to avoid CLS. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.4]

### Analytics
- Use `track()` with dedupe to avoid duplicate `*_view` events. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.9]

## Testing
- Manual perf traces confirm no >50ms animation tasks.
- Reduced motion tested to skip reveals.
