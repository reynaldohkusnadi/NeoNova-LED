# Story 2.3 â€” Proven Impact aux slot logic (`cardsAux[0]` optional)

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement the optional Proven Impact aux slot that renders when `cardsAux[0]` exists
**so that** the section shows auxiliary content without breaking layout when absent.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All section copy reads from `/content/site.ts`; no hardcoded strings. [Epic AC]
2. Keyboard navigation path verified; focus-visible styles present. [Epic AC]
3. No Client-side animation logic introduced. [Epic AC]
4. If `cardsAux[0]` exists, render; if not, layout collapses with no gap. [Source: prd/06-features.md#6.4; prd/05-content-and-information-architecture.md#5.6]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create aux slot component (RSC) that conditionally renders from `content.cardsAux[0]`
- [x] Support rendering as either a card within carousel or an intro block before Results Band (toggle via prop for now)
- [x] Ensure semantics and tabindex are correct for whichever mode is chosen

## Dev Notes

### Content Source
- Optional aux content in `content.cardsAux[0]`. [Source: prd/05-content-and-information-architecture.md#5.2]

### Behavior
- If absent, ensure no layout gap and no console errors. [Source: prd/06-features.md#6.4]

### Accessibility
- Semantics should fit the chosen rendering mode (card vs intro). [Source: prd/07-performance-accessibility-and-seo.md#7.2]

## Testing
- Unit test for both presence and absence of `cardsAux[0]` ensuring no layout break.
  - Implemented with `ProvenImpactAux.test.tsx`.
