# Story 2.4 â€” Results Band RSC shell hooked to 2 stats

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to build an RSC Results Band that renders two stats from `content.stats`,
**so that** the section displays correct copy without adding client animation yet.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All section copy reads from `/content/site.ts`; no hardcoded strings. [Epic AC]
2. Keyboard navigation path verified; focus-visible styles present. [Epic AC]
3. No Client-side animation logic introduced. [Epic AC]
4. Exactly 2 stats rendered from `content.stats` (value, suffix, label). [Source: prd/06-features.md#6.5; prd/05-content-and-information-architecture.md#5.3]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create `ResultsBand` RSC component that reads `[Stat, Stat]`
- [ ] Render stat value with suffix and label; ensure responsive layout
- [ ] Provide focusable targets for future client animation enhancements

## Dev Notes

### Content Source & Schema
- Tuple `[Stat, Stat]` ensures exactly 2 items. [Source: prd/05-content-and-information-architecture.md#5.3]

### Architecture Boundaries
- Keep RSC; animation later in EPIC-003. [Source: architecture/02-frontend-application-architecture.md#2.2]

### Accessibility
- Ensure numbers are announced meaningfully by screen readers (aria-label as needed). [Source: prd/07-performance-accessibility-and-seo.md#7.2]

## Testing
- Snapshot test confirms rendering of exactly 2 stats.
